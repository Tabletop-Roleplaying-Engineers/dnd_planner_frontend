<Paragraph>\n            У грі беруть участь ігровий майстер (Dungeon Master, DM, Майстер) та кілька гравців, зазвичай від 3-х до\n            6-ти. Для гри необхідні листи персонажів із записами їхніх характеристик, багатогранні кубики (на 4, 6, 8,\n            10, 12 та 20 граней), іноді розграфлене поле та мініатюрки. Кожен гравець керує діями одного персонажа\n            ігрового світу. Майстер діє від імені всіх неігрових персонажів (NPC, Non Player Character), таких як вороги\n            чи помічники. Також він описує сам світ і події, що в ньому відбуваються.\n          </Paragraph>\n        </Box>\n        \n        <Box my={10}>\n          <Paragraph>\n            Протягом гри кожен гравець задає дії для свого персонажа, а результати дій визначаються Майстром відповідно\n            до правил. Випадкові події моделюються киданням грального кубика (англ. dice). Іноді рішення майстра можуть\n            не відповідати правилам задля сприяння цікавості ігрового сеансу.
